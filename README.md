Fashion Recommendation System ðŸ‘—ðŸ¤–

This is a deep learning-based fashion recommendation system that suggests visually similar clothing items from a dataset. The system uses ResNet50, a powerful CNN architecture, for extracting image features and recommends products based on their visual similarity.

ðŸš€ Features

ðŸ§© How It Works
Image Feature Extraction:
The input images are passed through the ResNet50 model (excluding top layers) to obtain a 2048-dimensional feature vector.

Similarity Matching:
These vectors are compared with the pre-computed embeddings of the dataset using cosine similarity.

Recommendation:
The top 5 most similar items are returned based on similarity scores.
